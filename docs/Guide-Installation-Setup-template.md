<a id="requirements"></a> 
## 1. Requirements

1. We assume that you already have a project in Xcode and that this project is opened in Xcode 6 or later.
2. The SDK supports OS X 10.7 and later.

<a id="setup"></a>
## 2. Setup

We recommend integration of our binary into your Xcode project to setup HockeySDK for your OS X app. You can also use our interactive SDK integration wizard in <a href="http://hockeyapp.net/mac/">HockeyApp for Mac</a> which covers all the steps from below. For other ways to setup the SDK, see [Advanced Setup](#advancedsetup).

### 2.1 Obtain an App Identifier

Please see the "[How to create a new app](http://support.hockeyapp.net/kb/about-general-faq/how-to-create-a-new-app)" tutorial. This will provide you with an HockeyApp specific App Identifier to be used to initialize the SDK.

### 2.2 Download the SDK

1. Download the latest [HockeySDK-Mac](http://www.hockeyapp.net/releases/) framework which is provided as a zip-File.
2. Unzip the file and you will see a folder called `HockeySDK-Mac`. (Make sure not to use 3rd party unzip tools!)

### 2.3 Copy the SDK into your projects directory in Finder

From our experience, 3rd-party libraries usually reside inside a subdirectory (let's call our subdirectory `Vendor`), so if you don't have your project organized with a subdirectory for libraries, now would be a great start for it. To continue our example,  create a folder called `Vendor` inside your project directory and move the unzipped `HockeySDK-Mac`-folder into it. 

<a id="setupxcode"></a>
### 2.4 Set up the SDK in Xcode

1. We recommend to use Xcode's group-feature to create a group for 3rd-party-libraries similar to the structure of our files on disk. For example,  similar to the file structure in 2.3 above, our projects have a group called `Vendor`.
2. Make sure the `Project Navigator` is visible (⌘+1)
3. Drag & drop `HockeySDK.framework` from your window in the `Finder` into your project in Xcode and move it to the desired location in the `Project Navigator` (e.g. into the group called `Vendor`)
4. A popup will appear. Select `Create groups for any added folders` and set the checkmark for your target. Then click `Finish`.
5. Now we’ll make sure the framework is copied into your app bundle:
   - Click on your project in the `Project Navigator` (⌘+1).
   - Click your target in the project editor.
   - Click on the `Build Phases` tab.
   - Click the `Add Build Phase` button at the bottom and choose `Add Copy Files`.
   - Click the disclosure triangle next to the new build phase.
   - Choose `Frameworks` from the Destination list.
   - Drag `HockeySDK-Mac` from the Project Navigator left sidebar to the list in the new Copy Files phase.
   
6. Make sure to sign the app, since the SDK will store user related input in the keychain for privacy reasons

<a id="modifycode"></a>
### 2.5 Modify Code 

**Objective-C**

1. Open your `AppDelegate.m` file.
2. Add the following line at the top of the file below your own `import` statements:

	```objectivec
    @import HockeySDK
	```

3. Search for the method `applicationDidFinishLaunching:`
4. Add the following lines to setup and start the Application Insights SDK:

	```objectivec
    [[BITHockeyManager sharedHockeyManager] configureWithIdentifier:@"APP_IDENTIFIER"];
	// Do some additional configuration if needed here
    [[BITHockeyManager sharedHockeyManager] startManager];
	```

**Swift**

1. Open your `AppDelegate.swift` file.
2. Add the following line at the top of the file below your own import statements:
    
	```swift
	import HockeySDK
	```

3. Search for the method `applicationWillFinishLaunching`
4. Add the following lines to setup and start the Application Insights SDK:
    
	```swift
    BITHockeyManager.sharedHockeyManager().configureWithIdentifier("APP_IDENTIFIER");
	// Do some additional configuration if needed here
    BITHockeyManager.sharedHockeyManager().startManager();
	```

*Note:* In case of document based apps, invoke `startManager` at the end of `applicationDidFinishLaunching`, since otherwise you may lose the Apple events to restore, open untitled document etc.

If any crash report has been saved from the last time your application ran, `startManager` will present a dialog to allow the user to submit it. Once done, or if there are no crash logs, it will then call back to your `appDelegate` with `showMainApplicationWindowForCrashManager:` (if implemented, see [Improved startup crashes handling](#improvedstartup)).

**Congratulation, now you're all set to use HockeySDK!**

## 3. Advanced Setup

<a id="cocoapods"></a>
### 3.1 Setup with CocoaPods

[CocoaPods](http://cocoapods.org) is a dependency manager for Objective-C, which automates and simplifies the process of using 3rd-party libraries like HockeySDK in your projects. To learn how to setup CocoaPods for your project, visit the [official CocoaPods website](http://cocoapods.org/).

**Podfile**

    ```ruby
    platform :osx, '10.7'
    pod "HockeySDK-Mac"
    ```

<a name="crashreporting"></a>
### 3.2 Crash Reporting

The following options only show some of possibilities to interact and fine-tune the crash reporting feature. For more please check the full documentation of the `BITCrashManager` class in our [documentation](#documentation).

#### 3.2.1 Disable Crash Reporting
The HockeySDK enables crash reporting **per default**. Crashes will be immediately sent to the server the next time the app is launched.

To provide you with the best crash reporting, we are using [PLCrashReporter]("https://github.com/plausiblelabs/plcrashreporter") in [Version 1.2 / Commit 273a7e7cd4b77485a584ac82e77b7c857558e2f9]("https://github.com/plausiblelabs/plcrashreporter/commit/273a7e7cd4b77485a584ac82e77b7c857558e2f9").

This feature can be disabled as follows:

    ```objectivec
    [[BITHockeyManager sharedHockeyManager] configureWithIdentifier:@"APP_IDENTIFIER"];

    [[BITHockeyManager sharedHockeyManager] setDisableCrashManager: YES]; //disable crash reporting

    [[BITHockeyManager sharedHockeyManager] startManager];
    ```

#### 3.2.2 Autosend crash reports

Crashes are send the next time the app starts. If `crashManagerStatus` is set to `BITCrashManagerStatusAutoSend`, crashes will be send without any user interaction, otherwise an alert will appear allowing the users to decide whether they want to send the report or not.

    ```objectivec
    [[BITHockeyManager sharedHockeyManager] configureWithIdentifier:@"APP_IDENTIFIER"];

    [[BITHockeyManager sharedHockeyManager].crashManager setAutoSubmitCrashReport: YES];

    [[BITHockeyManager sharedHockeyManager] startManager];
    ```

The SDK is not sending the reports right when the crash happens deliberately, because if is not safe to implement such a mechanism while being async-safe (any Objective-C code is _NOT_ async-safe!) and not causing more danger like a deadlock of the device, than helping. We found that users do start the app again because most don't know what happened, and you will get by far most of the reports.

Sending the reports on startup is done asynchronously (non-blocking). This is the only safe way to ensure that the app won't be possibly killed by the iOS watchdog process, because startup could take too long and the app could not react to any user input when network conditions are bad or connectivity might be very slow.

<a id="exceptions"></a>
#### 3.2.3 Catch additional exceptions

On Mac OS X there are three types of crashes that are not reported to a registered `NSUncaughtExceptionHandler`:

1. Custom `NSUncaughtExceptionHandler` don't start working until after `NSApplication` has finished calling all of its delegate methods!

   Example:
       
       - (void)applicationDidFinishLaunching:(NSNotification *)note {
         ...
         [NSException raise:@"ExceptionAtStartup" format:@"This will not be recognized!"];
         ...
       }


2. The default `NSUncaughtExceptionHandler` in `NSApplication` only logs exceptions to the console and ends their processing. Resulting in exceptions that occur in the `NSApplication` "scope" not occurring in a registered custom `NSUncaughtExceptionHandler`.

   Example:
   
       - (void)applicationDidFinishLaunching:(NSNotification *)note {
         ...
         [self performSelector:@selector(delayedException) withObject:nil afterDelay:5];
        ...
      }

      - (void)delayedException {
        NSArray *array = [NSArray array];
        [array objectAtIndex:23];
      }

3. Any exceptions occurring in IBAction or other GUI does not even reach the NSApplication default UncaughtExceptionHandler.

   Example:
       
       - (IBAction)doExceptionCrash:(id)sender {
         NSArray *array = [NSArray array];
         [array objectAtIndex:23];
       }

In general there are two solutions. The first one is to use an `NSExceptionHandler` class instead of an `NSUncaughtExceptionHandler`. But this has a few drawbacks which are detailed in `BITCrashReportExceptionApplication.h`.

Instead we provide the optional `NSApplication` subclass `BITCrashExceptionApplication` which handles cases 2 and 3.

**Installation:**

* Open the applications `Info.plist`
* Search for the field `Principal class`
* Replace `NSApplication` with `BITCrashExceptionApplication`

Alternatively, if you have your own NSApplication subclass, change it to be a subclass of `BITCrashExceptionApplication` instead.

#### 3.2.4 Attach additional data

The `BITHockeyManagerDelegate` protocol provides methods to add additional data to a crash report:

1. UserID: `- (NSString *)userIDForHockeyManager:(BITHockeyManager *)hockeyManager componentManager:(BITHockeyBaseManager *)componentManager;`
2. UserName: `- (NSString *)userNameForHockeyManager:(BITHockeyManager *)hockeyManager componentManager:(BITHockeyBaseManager *)componentManager;`
3. UserEmail: `- (NSString *)userEmailForHockeyManager:(BITHockeyManager *)hockeyManager componentManager:(BITHockeyBaseManager *)componentManager;`

The `BITCrashManagerDelegate` protocol (which is automatically included in `BITHockeyManagerDelegate`) provides methods to add more crash specific data to a crash report:

1. Text attachments: `-(NSString *)applicationLogForCrashManager:(BITCrashManager *)crashManager`

   Check the following tutorial for an example on how to add CocoaLumberjack log data: [How to Add Application Specific Log Data on iOS or OS X](http://support.hockeyapp.net/kb/client-integration-ios-mac-os-x/how-to-add-application-specific-log-data-on-ios-or-os-x)
2. Binary attachments: `-(BITHockeyAttachment *)attachmentForCrashManager:(BITCrashManager *)crashManager`

Make sure to implement the protocol

    ```objectivec
    @interface YourAppDelegate () <BITHockeyManagerDelegate> {}

    @end
    ```

and set the delegate:

    ```objectivec
    [[BITHockeyManager sharedHockeyManager] configureWithIdentifier:@"APP_IDENTIFIER"];

    [[BITHockeyManager sharedHockeyManager] setDelegate: self];

    [[BITHockeyManager sharedHockeyManager] startManager];
    ```

<a name="feedback"></a>
### 3.3 Feedback

`BITFeedbackManager` lets your users communicate directly with you via the app and an integrated user interface. It provides a single threaded discussion with a user running your app. This feature is only enabled, if you integrate the actual view controllers into your app.
 
You should never create your own instance of `BITFeedbackManager` but use the one provided by the `[BITHockeyManager sharedHockeyManager]`:
 
    ```objectivec
    [BITHockeyManager sharedHockeyManager].feedbackManager
   ```

Please check the [documentation](#documentation) of the `BITFeedbachManager` class on more information on how to leverage this feature.

### 3.4 Sparkle

<a name="sparklesetup"></a>
#### 3.4.1 Setup for beta distribution

1. Install the Sparkle SDK: [http://sparkle-project.org](http://sparkle-project.org)
  
  As of today (03/2013), Sparkle doesn't support Mac sandboxes. If you require this, check out the following fork [https://github.com/tumult/Sparkle](https://github.com/tumult/Sparkle) and this discussion [https://github.com/andymatuschak/Sparkle/pull/165](https://github.com/andymatuschak/Sparkle/pull/165)
  
2. Set `SUFeedURL` to `https://rink.hockeyapp.net/api/2/apps/<APP_IDENTIFIER>` and replace `<APP_IDENTIFIER>` with the same value used to initialize the HockeySDK

3. Create a `.zip` file of your app bundle and upload that to HockeyApp.

<a name="betaanalytics"></a>
#### 3.4.2 Add analytics data to Sparkle setup

1. Set the following additional Sparkle property:

        ```objectivec
        sparkleUpdater.sendsSystemProfile = YES;
        ```

2. Add the following Sparkle delegate method (don't forget to bind `SUUpdater` to your appDelegate!):

        ```objectivec
        - (NSArray *)feedParametersForUpdater:(SUUpdater *)updater
                        sendingSystemProfile:(BOOL)sendingProfile {
            return [[BITSystemProfile sharedSystemProfile] systemUsageData];
        }
        ```

3. Initialize usage tracking depending on your needs.

    On example scenario is when the app is started or comes to foreground and when it goes to background or is terminated:

        ```objectivec
        - (void)applicationWillFinishLaunching:(NSNotification *)aNotification
            …      
            NSNotificationCenter *dnc = [NSNotificationCenter defaultCenter];
            BITSystemProfile *bsp = [BITSystemProfile sharedSystemProfile];
            [dnc addObserver:bsp selector:@selector(startUsage) name:NSApplicationDidBecomeActiveNotification object:nil];
            [dnc addObserver:bsp selector:@selector(stopUsage) name:NSApplicationWillTerminateNotification object:nil];
            [dnc addObserver:bsp selector:@selector(stopUsage) name:NSApplicationWillResignActiveNotification object:nil];
            …
        };
        ```

<a id="debug"></a>
### 3.5 Debug information

To check if data is send properly to HockeyApp and also see some additional SDK debug log data in the console, add the following line before `startManager`:

    ```objectivec
    [[BITHockeyManager sharedHockeyManager] configureWithIdentifier:@"APP_IDENTIFIER"];

    [[BITHockeyManager sharedHockeyManager] setDebugLogEnabled:YES];

    [[BITHockeyManager sharedHockeyManager] startManager];
    ```
